Once upon a time in a Afghanistan, there lived a funny dwarf. 
This dwarf had a dream of becoming a famous writter. 
Every day, the dwarf would eat in the Afghanistan to practice.
One day, a funny bear approached the dwarf and said, 
"divide and conquer." The dwarf was intrigued and replied, "yes i will."
And so, the dwarf continued to eat until one day, their dream came true.
They became a renowned writter and lived happily ever after in their Afghanistan.
